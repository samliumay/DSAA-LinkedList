# DSAA-LinkedList
* DSAA = Data Structures and Algorithms 

## Introduction 
* As a data structures and algorithms fan, I wanted to create a lesson series for people who are trying to pass Data structres and Algorithms courses. The video explanations are at my superpeer. 

## What is included at this page and inside the codes? 
* Basic explanation of how LinkedList works.
* Complexitys of the functions like insert delete ext.
* Explanations are integrated inside the codes. So by rewritting the code with comments, you will able to have at least a basic understanding of LinkedLists.

## What do you explain at superpeer?
* Detailed explanation from scratch.
* Questions and problems of LinkedList with their explanation.
* Turkish and English version(s) of lessons.
