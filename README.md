# DSAA - LinkedList 
- DSAA = Data structures and Algorithms
## Explanation of Time Complexity
- Explains how Linked list works. 
- Explains the complexity of the functions and how to calculate it. 

# How to use/read and study?
0- Wathch the video for complexity I uploaded to youtube (Will be here soon)

1- Enter the 'CTAL/src/main/java/Main.java'

2- Firslty run the code and observe the output.

3- Then look to the 'Node.java' and 'LinkedList.java'.

4- Read all lines one by one with the detailed explanation. 



NOTE-1: All the explanations and notes are integrated inside the code. So you can follow and learn just by reading the code. 

NOTE-2: Feel free to give feedback to me. I want to improve myself. If you want you can also take me a coffe :)
