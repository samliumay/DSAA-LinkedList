# DSAA-LinkedList
* DSAA = Data Structures and Algorithms 

## Introduction 
* As a data structures and algorithms fan, I wanted to create a lesson series for people who are trying to pass Data structres and Algorithms courses. The video explanations are at my superpeer. 

## What is included at this page and inside the codes? 
* Basic explanation of how LinkedList works.
* Complexitys of the functions like insert delete ext.
* Explanations are integrated inside the codes. So by rewritting the code with comments, you will able to have at least a basic understanding of LinkedLists.

## What do you explain at superpeer?
* I will explain all linkedlists concepts from scratch. 
* I will write everything by explaining one by one from scratch. 
* You will have Turkish and English versions of the lessons. Depends to you which one you will choose. 

## Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/samliumay/DSAA-LinkedList.git
